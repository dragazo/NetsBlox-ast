# NetsBlox-AST

**For the time being, this crate is in active development and its API is highly unstable**

[NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/) is a block-based programming language (extended from [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/)) which provides access to advanced web and distributed computing capabilities such as accessing web APIs and sending messages between clients (e.g. to create multi-user programs). NetsBlox-AST is a rust crate that takes as input a NetsBlox project XML file and outputs a sanitized Abstract Syntax Tree, which is useful for code generation.
